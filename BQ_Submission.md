### Q1: To prove the equation:


$
\sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{x_l \in C_k} \|x_l - m_k\|^2 + \sum_{k=1}^K n_k \|m_k - \mathbf{m}\|^2 = \sum_l \|x_l - \mathbf{m}\|^2,
$

- $C_k$: The $ k $-th cluster containing data points $ x_l $.
- $ m_k $: The centroid (mean) of cluster $ C_k $, defined as:
  $
  m_k = \frac{1}{n_k} \sum_{x_l \in C_k} x_l,
  $
  where $ n_k $ is the number of points in $ C_k $.
- $\mathbf{m} $: The global mean of all points, defined as:
  $
  \mathbf{m} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_l x_l,
  $
  where $ N = \sum_{k=1}^K n_k $.

we proceed as follows:

The total variance is given by:
$
\sum_l \|x_l - \mathbf{m}\|^2 = \sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{x_l \in C_k} \|x_l - \mathbf{m}\|^2.
$
For each point $ x_l $ in $ C_k $, we decompose $ x_l - \mathbf{m} $ as:
$
x_l - \mathbf{m} = (x_l - m_k) + (m_k - \mathbf{m}).
$
Using the squared norm property, we expand:
$
\|x_l - \mathbf{m}\|^2 = \|x_l - m_k\|^2 + 2 \langle x_l - m_k, m_k - \mathbf{m} \rangle + \|m_k - \mathbf{m}\|^2.
$

Summing over all points in cluster $ C_k $:
$
\sum_{x_l \in C_k} \|x_l - \mathbf{m}\|^2 = \sum_{x_l \in C_k} \|x_l - m_k\|^2 + \sum_{x_l \in C_k} 2 \langle x_l - m_k, m_k - \mathbf{m} \rangle + \sum_{x_l \in C_k} \|m_k - \mathbf{m}\|^2.
$

The second term, $ \sum_{x_l \in C_k} \langle x_l - m_k, m_k - \mathbf{m} \rangle $, vanishes because $ m_k $ is the mean of $ C_k $, implying:
$
\sum_{x_l \in C_k} (x_l - m_k) = 0.
$

Thus, we are left with:
$
\sum_{x_l \in C_k} \|x_l - \mathbf{m}\|^2 = \sum_{x_l \in C_k} \|x_l - m_k\|^2 + n_k \|m_k - \mathbf{m}\|^2,
$
where $ n_k = |C_k| $ is the number of points in cluster $ C_k $.

Summing over all clusters $ k $:
$
\sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{x_l \in C_k} \|x_l - \mathbf{m}\|^2 = \sum_{k=1}^K \left( \sum_{x_l \in C_k} \|x_l - m_k\|^2 + n_k \|m_k - \mathbf{m}\|^2 \right).
$

This simplifies to:
$
\sum_l \|x_l - \mathbf{m}\|^2 = \sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{x_l \in C_k} \|x_l - m_k\|^2 + \sum_{k=1}^K n_k \|m_k - \mathbf{m}\|^2.
$

We have shown that the total variance can be decomposed into the sum of the within-cluster variance and the between-cluster variance:
$
\sum_l \|x_l - \mathbf{m}\|^2 = \sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{x_l \in C_k} \|x_l - m_k\|^2 + \sum_{k=1}^K n_k \|m_k - \mathbf{m}\|^2.
$

### Q3: What are the differences between batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent (SGD),and mini-batch gradient descent?

| **Method**                | **Update Frequency**      | **Efficiency**          | **Convergence Stability**   | **Best For**                              |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Batch Gradient Descent    | After entire dataset      | Slow (large datasets)    | High (smooth updates)       | Small datasets                           |
| Stochastic Gradient Descent | After each data point     | Fast                     | Low (oscillations)          | Large/streaming datasets                 |
| Mini-Batch Gradient Descent | After each mini-batch     | Balanced                 | Medium (more stable than SGD) | Large datasets, general-purpose training |

### Q4: Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization. What impact do they have on model weights? 
| **Aspect**          | **L1 Regularization**           | **L2 Regularization**          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Effect on Weights**| Encourages sparsity (zeros)     | Shrinks weights uniformly      |
| **Feature Selection**| Performs implicit feature selection by zeroing out irrelevant features | Retains all features but reduces their magnitudes |
| **Optimization**     | Leads to sparse gradients (non-differentiable at zero) | Smooth gradients (always differentiable) |
| **Use Case**         | When feature selection is needed | When all features are important 

---

### Q5: What is dropout in neural networks, and why is it used? How does it prevent overfitting?
**Dropout** is a regularization technique used in neural networks to reduce overfitting. During training, dropout randomly "drops out" (sets to zero) a fraction of neurons in the network for each forward and backward pass.


#### How Dropout Works
1. **Random Neuron Selection**:
   - At each training step, a fraction (e.g., 20-50%) of neurons are randomly selected and temporarily ignored. This means they do not participate in the forward or backward pass.
   - The neurons are "dropped out" only during training; during testing or inference, all neurons are used.

2. **Scaling During Testing**:
   - During inference, the weights of neurons are scaled to account for the dropout effect, ensuring consistent outputs compared to training.


#### Why is Dropout Used?
Dropout is primarily used to:
1. **Prevent Overfitting**:
   - Neural networks, especially deep ones, can memorize the training data, leading to poor generalization on unseen data.
   - Dropout forces the network to learn more robust features by not relying too heavily on any single neuron.
   
2. **Improve Generalization**:
   - By training with different subsets of neurons active in each step, the network becomes more adaptable and generalizes better to unseen data.


#### How Does Dropout Prevent Overfitting?
**Acts Like Ensemble Learning**:
   - Dropout can be thought of as training many smaller subnetworks, as each training step involves a different combination of active neurons.
   - At test time, combining all neurons effectively averages the predictions of these subnetworks, which reduces overfitting.

### Q6: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning. How can you detect and address high bias or high variance in a model?
#### **Tradeoff Explanation**
- A model with **high bias** is simple but misses important patterns (underfitting).
- A model with **high variance** is complex but captures noise (overfitting).
- The goal is to find the optimal balance where the model generalizes well to unseen data.


#### **Detecting High Bias or High Variance**
1. **High Bias (Underfitting)**:
   - Training error is high.
   - Validation error is also high and close to the training error.
2. **High Variance (Overfitting)**:
   - Training error is low.
   - Validation error is high (large gap between training and validation errors).


#### **Addressing High Bias**
- **Use a More Complex Model**:
  - Switch to a model with higher capacity (e.g., polynomial regression instead of linear regression, or deeper neural networks).
- **Add Features**:
  - Include additional relevant features to capture more complexity.
- **Reduce Regularization**:
  - Loosen constraints like L1/L2 regularization or dropout to allow the model to fit the data better.

#### **Addressing High Variance**
- **Simplify the Model**:
  - Reduce the complexity of the model (e.g., limit the depth of decision trees or reduce the number of layers in neural networks).
- **Add More Data**:
  - Increasing the dataset size helps the model generalize better.
- **Regularization**:
  - Add L1/L2 regularization or dropout to constrain the model and prevent overfitting.
- **Cross-Validation**:
  - Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data during training.

### Q7: Explain the role of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers in a CNN. How does each contribute to the model's learning process?
####  **Convolutional Layers**
- **Role**: Feature Extraction
- **How It Works**:
  - Applies filters (kernels) to the input to detect patterns like edges, textures, and shapes.
  - Each filter slides over the input, performing a dot product between the filter's weights and the input's values, producing a **feature map**.
  - Early layers detect simple features (e.g., edges), while deeper layers detect complex patterns (e.g., objects).

- **Contribution to Learning**:
  - Identifies hierarchical patterns.
  - Preserves spatial relationships (e.g., nearby pixels' connections in images).


####  **Pooling Layers**
- **Role**: Downsampling and Feature Consolidation
- **How It Works**:
  - Reduces the spatial dimensions (height and width) of feature maps while retaining important information.
  - Common pooling methods:
    - **Max Pooling**: Takes the maximum value in a region (e.g., \(2 \times 2\) window).
    - **Average Pooling**: Takes the average value in a region.

- **Contribution to Learning**:
  - Reduces the computational cost by lowering the number of parameters.
  - Helps make the model invariant to small translations or distortions in the input.
  - Prevents overfitting by focusing on the most prominent features.

####  **Fully Connected (Dense) Layers**
- **Role**: Decision Making
- **How It Works**:
  - Flattens the high-level feature maps into a single vector.
  - Each neuron is connected to every input, combining extracted features into a final prediction.
  - Typically placed at the end of the network.

- **Contribution to Learning**:
  - Acts as the classifier in the CNN.
  - Maps the extracted features to output classes (e.g., "cat," "dog").
  - Adds nonlinearity and complexity to the model’s decision process.

### Summary of Contributions

| **Layer Type**           | **Primary Role**                  | **Key Contribution**                                       |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Convolutional Layer**   | Feature Extraction               | Detects patterns and hierarchical features.               |
| **Pooling Layer**         | Dimensionality Reduction         | Simplifies feature maps, reduces parameters, and adds invariance. |
| **Fully Connected Layer** | Classification and Decision Making| Combines features to make the final prediction.           |

### Q8: What is transfer learning, and when is it useful? Provide an example of how you would use it in a practical application.
#### What is Transfer Learning?

**Transfer learning** is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is repurposed to solve a different but related task. Instead of training a model from scratch, you leverage the knowledge a pre-trained model has already acquired (e.g., feature representations) to accelerate learning on a new problem.

#### When is Transfer Learning Useful?

Transfer learning is particularly useful when:
1. **Limited Data is Available**:
   - Training deep models from scratch requires large datasets. Transfer learning works well when you only have a small dataset for your task.
2. **Similar Tasks Exist**:
   - The tasks share commonalities, such as both involving image classification or text processing.
3. **Computational Resources are Limited**:
   - Training large models from scratch can be computationally expensive. Transfer learning leverages pre-trained weights, saving time and resources.

### How Does Transfer Learning Work?

1. **Start with a Pre-Trained Model**:
   - Use a model like ResNet, VGG, or BERT, which is trained on a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet for images, or large corpora for NLP).
2. **Fine-Tune on Your Dataset**:
   - Adjust the weights of the model using your specific dataset, typically focusing on the later layers, while earlier layers remain mostly unchanged.
3. **Modify for Your Task**:
   - Replace the original output layer (e.g., classification head) with a new one suited to your specific labels or outputs.

#### Example Scenario: Classifying Medical X-Rays
- **Problem**: You want to classify chest X-rays into categories like "normal" or "pneumonia," but you have a small dataset of labeled X-rays.
- **Approach**:
  1. **Pre-Trained Model**:
     - Use a model pre-trained on ImageNet (e.g., ResNet-50) as the base.
  2. **Adapt the Model**:
     - Replace the final fully connected layer (e.g., 1000 classes for ImageNet) with a new layer for "normal" and "pneumonia."
  3. **Fine-Tune**:
     - Train the modified model on your small X-ray dataset. Freeze earlier layers to retain general features like edges and textures, and fine-tune the later layers to specialize in medical imagery.
  4. **Result**:
     - A model that accurately classifies X-rays with much less training data and time compared to training from scratch.

### Q9: How would you explain the predictions of a black-box model like a neural network? Discuss techniques like LIME and SHAP.
#### **A. LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**
- **How It Works**:
  1. Perturbs the input by creating slight variations (e.g., random noise).
  2. Observes how the model's predictions change in response to these perturbations.
  3. Fits a simpler, interpretable model (like linear regression) locally around the specific prediction.
  4. Identifies the features most responsible for the prediction in this local context.

- **Strengths**:
  - Model-agnostic: Works with any black-box model.
  - Explains individual predictions rather than the overall behavior of the model.


#### **B. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**
- **How It Works**:
  1. Based on game theory, SHAP calculates the **Shapley value** of each feature, representing its average contribution to the prediction.
  2. Considers all possible combinations of features to fairly allocate credit (or blame) for the prediction.
  3. Produces a global or local explanation:
     - **Global**: Average contributions of features across the dataset.
     - **Local**: Contributions for a single prediction.

- **Strengths**:
  - Theoretical foundation ensures fairness in how contributions are assigned.
  - Provides both local and global explanations.


#### **Comparison of LIME and SHAP**

| **Aspect**             | **LIME**                              | **SHAP**                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Interpretation Scope**| Local (individual predictions)         | Both local and global explanations    |
| **Computation Cost**    | Faster (approximates locally)          | Slower (considers all feature combinations) |
| **Fairness**            | Approximate fairness                  | Theoretically fair                    |
| **Complexity**          | Simpler to implement                  | More computationally intensive        |

### Q11: Given two probability distributions: P=[0.2,0.5,0.3], Q=[0.1,0.7,0.2]. Calculate the KullbackLeibler (KL) divergence $D_{KL}(P∥Q)$.
#### Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence

The KL divergence $D_{KL}(P \| Q)$ is calculated using the formula:

$

$

Given:
$
P = [0.2, 0.5, 0.3], \quad Q = [0.1, 0.7, 0.2]
$

#### Calculation:
$
D_{KL}(P \| Q) = 0.2 \cdot \log\left(\frac{0.2}{0.1}\right) + 0.5 \cdot \log\left(\frac{0.5}{0.7}\right) + 0.3 \cdot \log\left(\frac{0.3}{0.2}\right)
$

$

### Q12:How does the learning rate affect the convergence of gradient descent? What issues can arise from choosing a learning rate that is too high or too low? 
#### How the Learning Rate Affects Gradient Descent

- **High Learning Rate**: Takes larger steps towards the minimum.
- **Low Learning Rate**: Takes smaller steps towards the minimum.



#### Effects of Learning Rate on Convergence

##### 1. **Too High Learning Rate**
- **Effect**:
  - The algorithm may overshoot the minimum because of excessively large updates.
  - Can cause the loss function to oscillate or even diverge instead of converging.
- **Issues**:
  - **Non-Convergence**: The model fails to settle near the minimum.
  - **Instability**: Loss values fluctuate wildly.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Loss graph shows erratic behavior without settling to a minimum.

#### 2. **Too Low Learning Rate**
- **Effect**:
  - The model updates weights very slowly, resulting in sluggish convergence.
- **Issues**:
  - **Slow Training**: The model may take an unreasonably long time to converge.
  - **Risk of Getting Stuck**: It may get trapped in local minima or saddle points.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Loss graph descends very slowly and flattens prematurely.

### Q13: What is data-centric learning? What are the assumptions of influence functions? 
#### What is Data-Centric Learning?

**Data-centric learning** emphasizes the quality and relevance of the data used in machine learning, as opposed to focusing solely on improving model architectures. The core idea is to ensure that the data is clean, well-labeled, and representative of the task, as the performance of models is highly dependent on the quality of the data they are trained on.

#### Key Principles:
1. **Data Quality over Model Complexity**:
   - A simpler model with high-quality data can outperform a complex model trained on noisy or biased data.
2. **Iterative Data Improvements**:
   - Focus on strategies like better data labeling, removing outliers, and augmenting data to improve model performance.
3. **Complementary to Model-Centric Learning**:
   - While model-centric approaches optimize the model, data-centric learning ensures the input to the model is optimal.

#### What are Influence Functions?

**Influence functions** are mathematical tools used to understand how the training data impacts a model's predictions. They help estimate the effect of adding, modifying, or removing a particular data point from the training set without retraining the model.

#### Assumptions of Influence Functions:
1. **Twice-Differentiable Loss Function**:
   - The loss function must be smooth and twice differentiable with respect to the model parameters.
   - Ensures that gradients and Hessians (second derivatives) can be computed accurately.

2. **Model Near Optimality**:
   - Assumes the model parameters are close to a local optimum.
   - Influence functions rely on approximations that hold true only in the neighborhood of this optimum.

3. **Independence of Data Points**:
   - Assumes that each data point contributes independently to the overall loss, which may not hold in cases of correlated or dependent data.

4. **Finite Training Data**:
   - Influence functions are derived for finite datasets, and their accuracy diminishes for very large datasets due to computational limitations.

### Q14: What is AI discrimination? How to mitigate model unfairness? 
#### What is AI Discrimination?

**AI discrimination** occurs when an AI model produces biased outcomes or decisions that unfairly disadvantage certain groups based on attributes like race, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. This happens when the model inadvertently learns biases present in the training data or when societal inequities are reflected in the input data.

#### How to Mitigate Model Unfairness?

#### 1. **Bias Detection**
- Analyze data and predictions for disparate impact or unequal outcomes.
- Use fairness metrics:
  - **Demographic Parity**: Ensure positive outcomes are equally distributed across groups.
  - **Equalized Odds**: Ensure equal false positive and false negative rates across groups.
  - **Individual Fairness**: Similar individuals should receive similar outcomes.

#### 2. **Strategies to Reduce Bias**

##### **A. Data-Level Solutions**
- **Balanced Sampling**:
  - Ensure all demographic groups are well-represented in the dataset.
- **Data Augmentation**:
  - Add synthetic examples for underrepresented groups.
- **Label Auditing**:
  - Check for and correct mislabeled or biased data.

##### **B. Algorithmic Solutions**
- **Fairness Constraints**:
  - Incorporate fairness objectives into the loss function during training.
- **Adversarial Debiasing**:
  - Train a secondary model to minimize bias while preserving accuracy.
- **Reweighing**:
  - Adjust weights of training samples to balance group representation.

##### **C. Post-Processing Solutions**
- **Output Adjustment**:
  - Modify the model’s predictions to enforce fairness metrics (e.g., adjust thresholds for different groups).
- **Calibration**:
  - Align probabilities across groups to ensure equal predictive performance.

#### 3. **Ethical Oversight**
- Formulate guidelines for responsible AI development.
- Include diverse perspectives in the design, testing, and evaluation stages.

### Q15: You have developed a predictive maintenance model for a manufacturing plant to forecast equipment failure. What steps would you take to deploy this model into production? How would you monitor the model’s performance over time? If you observe model drift, how would you address it?
### Steps to Deploy a Predictive Maintenance Model into Production

#### 1. **Model Deployment Preparation**
- **Ensure Model Robustness**:
  - Test the model with unseen data from various operating conditions to ensure reliability.
  - Validate the model with cross-validation and stress testing.
- **Select Deployment Environment**:
  - Choose a production environment suitable for your use case (e.g., on-premises for real-time equipment monitoring or cloud-based for scalability).

#### 2. **Develop an API for Model Serving**
- Create a RESTful API or similar interface to allow applications to query the model with real-time or batch data.
- Use frameworks like Flask, FastAPI, or tools like TensorFlow Serving or TorchServe.

#### 3. **Set Up Data Pipelines**
- **Input Pipeline**:
  - Ensure data from sensors or logs is preprocessed consistently before being fed into the model.
- **Output Integration**:
  - Route predictions to the appropriate systems (e.g., maintenance alerts or dashboards).

#### 4. **Model Deployment**
- Use tools like Docker for containerization to ensure consistency across environments.
- Deploy the model using orchestration platforms like Kubernetes for scaling and reliability.

#### 5. **Monitoring Infrastructure**
- Set up monitoring for:
  - Model predictions (accuracy, false alarms, and missed failures).
  - Input data integrity (e.g., missing sensor data or abnormal patterns).
  - Latency of predictions.

#### Monitoring the Model’s Performance Over Time

#### Key Metrics:
- **Prediction Accuracy**:
  - Compare predicted failures with actual outcomes.
- **False Positives/Negatives**:
  - Monitor for frequent false alarms (false positives) or missed failures (false negatives).
- **Model Latency**:
  - Measure the time taken for predictions, ensuring real-time systems are responsive.

#### Handling Model Drift

**Model drift** occurs when the relationship between input data and target outputs changes, leading to degraded model performance. This can be caused by:
- **Data Drift**: Changes in sensor data distributions (e.g., new equipment or environmental changes).
- **Concept Drift**: Changes in the underlying failure patterns.

#### Steps to Address Model Drift:
1. **Detect Drift**:
   - Use statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) to compare input data distributions over time.
   - Monitor metrics like prediction accuracy or alert rates for deviations.

2. **Retrain the Model**:
   - Collect new labeled data and retrain the model on updated patterns.
   - Use incremental learning if the new data arrives continuously.

3. **Regularly Refresh Data Pipelines**:
   - Ensure incoming data reflects current operating conditions (e.g., changes in equipment or maintenance schedules).

4. **Ensemble Models**:
   - Combine the current model with an adaptive model trained on recent data to handle drift dynamically.

5. **Periodic Model Revalidation**:
   - Schedule periodic evaluations and retraining as part of maintenance protocols.

### Q16: You are developing a self-driving car system that relies on image recognition to detect road signs. How would you design the pipeline for processing images in real-time? What techniques would you use to handle edge cases, such as partially obscured or damaged road signs? How would you evaluate the performance of your model in a way that ensures safety and robustness?
#### **A. Pipeline Design**

1. **Image Capture**:
   - Use high-resolution cameras with wide dynamic range to handle varying lighting conditions.
   - Capture images at a frame rate sufficient for smooth processing (e.g., 30 FPS or higher).

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - **Resizing**: Resize images to a consistent resolution to match the model’s input size.
   - **Normalization**: Scale pixel values (e.g., [0, 255] → [0, 1]) for stable model performance.
   - **Denoising**: Apply Gaussian blur or median filtering to reduce noise.
   - **Color Correction**: Enhance contrast or brightness for improved visibility.

3. **Object Detection**:
   - Use a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN) to localize potential road signs in the image.
   - Filter out irrelevant regions using bounding boxes.

4. **Sign Classification**:
   - Feed detected regions into a road sign classification model to determine the specific type (e.g., stop sign, speed limit).
   - Employ a fine-tuned CNN trained on a labeled dataset of road signs.

5. **Post-Processing**:
   - Apply heuristics to reject false positives (e.g., check the size or aspect ratio of detected signs).
   - Use temporal smoothing (e.g., Kalman filters) to stabilize detections across frames.

6. **Integration with Decision System**:
   - Pass recognized signs to the car's control system for appropriate actions (e.g., slow down for a stop sign).


#### **B. Handling Edge Cases**

1. **Partially Obscured Signs**:
   - Use **data augmentation** during training:
     - Include examples of occluded or cropped signs.
     - Apply transformations like partial masking or blurring to simulate real-world conditions.
   - Implement **contextual reasoning**:
     - Leverage other sensors (e.g., LiDAR) or prior knowledge (e.g., typical sign placements along roads).

2. **Damaged or Weather-Affected Signs**:
   - Train on a diverse dataset with examples of damaged signs.
   - Use **generative techniques** (e.g., GANs) to synthesize variations of damaged signs.
   - Apply **feature-based matching** to compare detected signs with known templates for robustness.

3. **Uncommon Sign Shapes or Colors**:
   - Update the model with new classes as they appear in the environment.
   - Use **unsupervised anomaly detection** to flag unfamiliar signs for manual inspection.

4. **Multiple Signs in a Single Frame**:
   - Employ multi-object tracking algorithms to handle overlapping or adjacent signs.

#### **C. Evaluating Model Performance**

1. **Metrics for Evaluation**:
   - **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified signs.
   - **Precision and Recall**: Ensure the system minimizes false positives (precision) and captures all relevant signs (recall).
   - **Latency**: Measure end-to-end processing time to ensure real-time performance.
   - **Robustness**:
     - Test the model under varying lighting, weather, and traffic conditions.
     - Evaluate performance on occluded or damaged signs.

2. **Safety and Redundancy**:
   - Validate the system with a **failsafe mechanism**:
     - If confidence is low, fallback to other sources like maps or LiDAR data.
   - Test against an **extensive edge-case dataset** to simulate real-world scenarios.

3. **Simulation Testing**:
   - Use driving simulators to test the system in controlled environments with realistic variations.
   - Assess how the model performs in adverse conditions, such as heavy rain or low visibility.

4. **Field Testing**:
   - Deploy the system in a controlled test track environment with real-world signs.
   - Gradually expand to real-world roads with human supervision.
